# User Dashboard Specification - OrthoTransfer Platform

## Overview

The OrthoTransfer platform manages **two distinct user types** with completely different needs and workflows. This document outlines how each user type interacts with their dashboard and what data they need to manage.

## User Types & Their Purposes

### **1. PATIENTS**

-   **Goal**: Find orthodontists to continue their treatment after moving/transferring
-   **Status**: Auto-approved upon registration
-   **Primary Need**: Search for doctors based on location, treatment type, and financial constraints

### **2. DOCTORS**

-   **Goal**: Offer orthodontic transfer services to patients
-   **Status**: Require admin approval before accessing full features
-   **Primary Need**: Manage practice information and receive patient inquiries

## Database Schema Understanding

### **Core User Table**

```sql
users (
    id, first_name, last_name, email, password,
    role ENUM('admin', 'patient', 'doctor'),
    is_approved BOOLEAN (true for patients, requires approval for doctors),
    approved_at, approved_by
)
```

### **Address Management (BOTH user types)**

```sql
user_addresses (
    user_id, label, address_line_1, address_line_2,
    city, state, postal_code, country,
    latitude, longitude, is_current BOOLEAN
)
```

-   **Purpose**: Location-based doctor searches and practice locations
-   **Constraint**: Only ONE address can be marked as "current" per user
-   **Usage**: GPS coordinates for distance calculations

---

## PATIENT WORKFLOW & DATA

### **Patient Profile Table**

```sql
patient_profiles (
    user_id,
    age,
    radius_willing_to_drive (in miles),
    moving_temporarily BOOLEAN,
    current_orthodontist_name,
    orthodontist_address,
    original_treatment_length_months,
    remaining_financial_amount,
    doctor_type_id (preferred doctor type)
)
```

### **Patient Many-to-Many Relationships**

1. **Treatments** (`patient_treatments`): Current braces/aligners they have
2. **Functional Appliances** (`patient_functional_appliances`): Herbst, Twin Block, etc.
3. **TADs** (`patient_tads`): Mini-implants, Mini-screws, etc.

### **Patient Dashboard Needs**

-   âœ… **Profile Management**: Complete detailed orthodontic history
-   âœ… **Address Management**: Current location for doctor searches
-   ðŸ”„ **Doctor Search**: Find nearby doctors based on:
    -   Current address + radius willing to drive
    -   Treatment compatibility (matching current treatments)
    -   Financial constraints (remaining budget vs doctor's minimum payment)
    -   Doctor type preference
-   ðŸ”„ **Inquiry Management**: Send inquiries to selected doctors
-   ðŸ”„ **Messages**: Communicate with interested doctors

## DOCTOR WORKFLOW & DATA

### **Doctor Profile Table**

```sql
doctor_profiles (
    user_id,
    title (Dr., DDS, DMD, etc.),
    phone_number,
    website,
    bio,
    minimum_monthly_payment
)
```

### **Doctor Many-to-Many Relationships**

1. **Transfer Types** (`doctor_transfer_types`): What types they accept
    - Complete Case Transfer, Finishing Only, Retention Only, etc.
2. **Insurance Providers** (`doctor_insurance_providers`): What insurance they accept
    - Aetna, Cigna, Delta Dental, etc.

### **Doctor Dashboard Needs**

-   âœ… **Profile Management**: Professional information and practice details
-   âœ… **Address Management**: Practice locations
-   ðŸ”„ **Inquiry Management**: View/respond to patient inquiries
-   ðŸ”„ **Patient Search**: Browse patients in their area (if they want to reach out)
-   ðŸ”„ **Messages**: Communicate with potential patients
-   ðŸ”„ **Availability Management**: Set availability for new patients

---

## ADMIN-MANAGED OPTIONS

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### âœ… **COMPLETED**

1. **User Authentication**: Role-based registration and login
2. **Dashboard Layout**: Frontend-integrated with sidebar navigation
3. **Profile Management**: Role-specific forms for both user types
4. **Address Management**: Add/edit/delete with current address logic
5. **Database Schema**: Complete with all relationships
6. **Admin Options**: Seeded with real orthodontic data

### ðŸ”„ **NEXT PRIORITIES** (Based on User Needs)

#### **For Patients**

1. **Doctor Search Interface**:

    - Filter by location (current address + radius)
    - Filter by treatment compatibility
    - Filter by financial range
    - Filter by doctor type
    - Show distance from patient's current address

2. **Inquiry System**:
    - Send inquiries to selected doctors
    - Include patient's profile data automatically
    - Track inquiry status

#### **For Doctors**

1. **Inquiry Management**:

    - View patient inquiries with full patient profiles
    - Accept/decline inquiries
    - Set inquiry preferences

2. **Practice Management**:
    - Set availability status
    - Manage service areas
    - Set automated responses

## BUSINESS LOGIC RULES

### **Patient Rules**

-   Must have complete profile to search for doctors
-   Must have current address set
-   Can only search within their specified radius
-   Financial amount must be >= doctor's minimum payment

### **Doctor Rules**

-   Must be admin-approved to receive inquiries
-   Must have complete profile to appear in searches
-   Must have practice address (current address)
-   Must specify transfer types they accept

### **Matching Logic**

1. **Location**: Patient's current address + radius vs Doctor's practice location
2. **Treatment**: Patient's current treatments must be compatible with doctor's services
3. **Financial**: Patient's remaining budget >= Doctor's minimum payment
4. **Insurance**: Optional filter if patient has insurance doctor accepts

## DASHBOARD CUSTOMIZATION BY USER TYPE

### **Current Sidebar** (Same for Both)

-   Dashboard (overview/stats)
-   Profile (role-specific forms)
-   Addresses (location management)

### **Proposed Extended Sidebar**

#### **For Patients**

-   Dashboard
-   Profile âœ…
-   Addresses âœ…
-   **Find Doctors** (search interface)
-   **My Inquiries** (sent inquiries status)
-   **Messages** (doctor communications)

#### **For Doctors**

-   Dashboard
-   Profile âœ…
-   Addresses âœ… (Practice Locations)
-   **Patient Inquiries** (incoming requests)
-   **Messages** (patient communications)
-   **Practice Settings** (availability, preferences)

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### **Current Controllers**

-   `ProfileController`: âœ… Handles role-specific profile management
-   `AddressController`: âœ… Handles address CRUD with current address logic

### **Needed Controllers**

-   `DoctorSearchController`: Patient searches for doctors
-   `InquiryController`: Patient-doctor inquiry system
-   `MessageController`: Communication between users
-   `PracticeController`: Doctor practice management

### **Current Models & Relationships** âœ…

All models are properly set up with correct relationships and the database schema supports the complete workflow.

This specification serves as the foundation for implementing the remaining features. The current dashboard framework (layout, forms, address management) is solid and ready for the next phase of development.
